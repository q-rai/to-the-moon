\subsection*{Showers}
There are no showers. To keep yourself clean, bring wet wipes or biodegradable soap.
Please don't clean your dishes or yourself in the river since there are mussels in the river that are protected wildlife.  (And these are also the reason you should wear river shoes while in the river as the mussels will cut you. They're mean that way.)

\subsection*{Ice}
Ice will be soled from noon to 3 \pm every day for \$2 per 10 lbs bag.  Cash only! Bring small bills please. 


\subsection*{Lost and Found}
The Lost and Found will be at the \gls{cockpit} / \gls{vc} station.

\subsection*{Port-a-Potties}
There are Port-a-Potties on-site. Please don't put anything other than one-ply toilet paper and human waste in the Port-a-Potties. You will find Port-a-Potties in multiple locations across the site.
