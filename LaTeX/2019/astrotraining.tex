\section*{Guidelines}
We have few rules and kindly ask you to follow them, for your safety and those around and with you.  Look at them as a compass to orient yourself by while drifting in the orbit of this event. 

\subsection*{Safety}
Safety is our number one concern and breaching perimeter is a \textbf{serious} offense we will handle swiftly. 

\subsubsection*{Fire Safety}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red}{If you breach effigy or temple perimeter, you will be removed from the property immediately -- no questions asked!}} 
\item No open ground and / or unattended fires. They must be contained and off ground. Please bring a fire bowl for this purpose. If you see a fire that is unattended or out of control, contact a Ranger immediately.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{River Safety}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Children under 13 must wear a flotation device.
  \item Children under 13 must wear water shoes (water shoes are highly recommended for  \textbf{Anyone} for added safety and traction, especially if caught in a current).
  \item All minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian when in the water.
  \item \textbf{Anyone caught committing the below two actions will be ejected from the burn immediately:}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item No jumping or diving off the bank into the river.
    \item No swimming after dark.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{No Pets}
\label{sub:nopets}

Spirit Crossing has a \textbf{no pet} policy!
%
Should you need a service animal’s assistance to safely navigate our premises, please let us know at the gate.  A ``service animal'' is a dog (or other animal) individually trained to do work or perform certain tasks for a person with a disability.

Please be prepared to answer the following two questions so we may better determine at our discretion if your animal falls under the Service Animal Category, and in order for us to be in compliance with ADA regulations:
%
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Is the service animal to the direct benefit of the disability?
\item What tasks and what work is the animal trained to perform in direct relation to the disability? 
\end{itemize}
 
% If your animal falls under one of the following categories, you will not be able to bring it into the festival grounds.

% Service Animals are \textbf{not}:
% \begin{multicols}{2}
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%   \item emotional support animals
%   \item therapeutic animals
%   \item companion animals
%   \item comfort animals
%   \item service animals in training
% \end{itemize}
% \end{multicols}

For your convenience, Scooby Shack Kennel is 20 minutes from Sneedville and can be reached at 423-921-0611.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding!

\subsection*{Respect the Laws of the Land}
Spirit Crossing, and Sneedville, are kind enough to be our home.  Here are some helpful tips on respect:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The property owner's house is off limits to participants.  Please be respectful of the land and grounds.
\item Although held on private property, TN Nudity Laws still apply. Please plan on wearing pasties, bikinis, loincloths, etc.
\item Please respect the land, the river, and the community.  Obey the speed limits and be courteous to those around you.
\item When in doubt, practice \textbf{consent}!
\item TTM  is an all ages event.  Those who are 21 or older will have a special wrist band indicating that they are able to legally consume alcohol. Please consume in moderation.
\end{itemize}
    
% \begin{multicols}{2}

% \subsection*{Alcohol}
% \gls{ttm} is an all ages event.  Those who are 21 or older will have a special wrist band indicating that they are able to legally consume alcohol.

% \subsection*{Camping}
% You may not camp in your car. Please bring a tent or RV / trailer.
% Cars may only be brought on site with approval.
% \bod[inline]{needs vetting}

% \subsection*{Code of Conduct}
% \Gls{ttm} now has a Code of Conduct. You can find it on page~\pageref{coc}.

\subsection*{Fireworks and Effects}
Fire effects with registered Theme Camps only, please.

\subsection*{\Gls{gifting}}\label{gifting}
This is a gifting community, providing refuge from everyday societal perils.  Once you're inside, no commercial activity takes place. Which is part of the charm, and the point :) 
Sometimes, there is a bit of a misconception of "Oh, so it's a barter system?" -- Actually, it's not. It's a "Gifting" Principle.
You gift without the expectation of a gift in return. 
You gift something to someone because at that moment, you feel the other person should have the very thing you'd like to give.

% \subsection*{\Gls{graywater}}
% There are no plans to dispose of gray water on site.  Each participant is responsible for \gls{pipo}.

% \subsection*{Nudity}
% TN Nudity Laws prohibit full or partial nudity on public property, and while we are on private property, the road cutting through Spirit Crossing is public, mostly accessed by residents, so very low traffic.

% We recommend you use discretion and wear pasties, paint, bikinis, etc.

\subsection*{Minors}
Minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. If they cause problems during the event which lead to possible safety issues or are a severe nuisance to others, we may ask you to remove the offending minor, possibly your entire camp. Minors are NOT allowed to use, play with, operate nor hold fire, fire props, fire effects and pyro, including poofers.  

%\subsection*{Public Health and Safety}

\subsection*{Recharging batteries for medical equipment}
Those with CPAPs and electronic scooters will have to make their own arrangements to recharge batteries.  \gls{ttm} does not provide battery recharging stations for medical equipment.

Some theme camps have generators, and may allow use of a spare generator plug for recharging medical equipment as a way of \gls{gifting}.  Home Depot and other companies also rent generators.  Moreover, there exist solar panels for recharging CPAP machines, though those can be prohibitively expensive.

\subsection*{Photography}
Please respect the right of others who may not wish to be photographed. Ask \textbf{permission}! If you see someone with a \textcolor{blue}{blue} wristband, that is a \textbf{no photo} policy indicator. 
Do not take pictures or video of participants wearing them! 

\subsection*{Sound}
To make this event enjoyable for all, amplified sound is limited to 300 Watts producing 90 db at 20 feet. All amplified sound is to be reduced after 4\am nightly to allow room for acoustic and ambient sound and to limit the possibility of neighboring sound complaints. 

\subsection*{Wristbands}
\label{sub:wristbands}
You will receive a wristband when you arrive at the \gls{gate}.  Different colored wristbands will identify you as being over 21, under 18, etc.  Wristband colors also indicate if you don't want your photo taken.  

You must keep your wristband on at all times.  See the \gls{gate} if you need to replace your wristband.

\subsection*{Vending}
No vending, selling, or promoting is allowed at the event.


\section*{Community Standards}

\subsection*{The Ten Principles}\label{tenprinciples}
Table \ref{tbl:tenprincples} on page \pageref{tbl:tenprincples} enumerates the 10 Principles of \gls{ttm}.
Funny thing about those: they are not meant to be chosen at random to suit ones need, mood or agenda, but according to our interpretation were created to work together as a whole.  
Meaning your right to radically and freely express yourself ends when your expression infringes upon another participant to do the same. 
In other words, they're not a "Getting out of jail free" card, nor a permission slip to be a dick. So don't be a dick, hiding behind one or two principles.

\subsection*{The 11th Principle -- Consent}

\gls{ttm} has adopted the 11th Principle, Consent\footnote{\url{http://www.11thprincipleconsent.org/2015/10/20/what-do-you-consent-to/}}.

% \begin{itemize}
\begin{labeling}{Photography:}
	\item[Touch:] Just because you hugged someone yesterday doesn't mean you can surprise them with a hug today. ``Surprise contact'' isn't always wanted, even if it's affectionate.
	\item[Foods:] Disclose the ingredients, one person's innocuous ingredient can be someone else's allergy.
	\item[Kink:] Consent for one thing isn't consent for another. If I said you can spank me, that doesn't give you permission to grope me.
	\item[Sex:] Consent can be revoked once it's been given.
	\item[Gifts:] Disclose what is in your gifts, even if it's just essential oils. Some people have sensitivities.
	\item[Photography:] Ask before taking pictures. Remember consent to take a picture is NOT consent to post it on your blog.
\end{labeling}
% \end{itemize}
