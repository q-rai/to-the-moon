Printshop Provides:: Acrylic \& Tempera Paints, brushes, Paper \& cloth to decorate, Baby wipes to cleanse the canvas. If you want, supplement your experience with something to stamp: A stolen flag? a t-shirt? that camp chair that's about to fall apart?

\begin{description}[leftmargin=6em,noitemsep,style=nextline]
   \item[Location:] Axis Mundi
    \item[Time:] 3:30 PM -- 4:30 PM
\end{description}

Axis Mundi is known as the hub or axis of the universe, interpreted by many cultures in a wide spectrum of ways. However, the central theme among the sacred symbols is the connection of the underworld, the Earth, and the sky – a dichotomy of integration (oneness) and distance (separate-ness). The roots run deep between theology, culture, and the understanding the universe (which we now call cosmology). Has the universe come into existence a finite time ago? How did it come to be? Will it come to an end? Why are the cosmic evolution and the laws of nature of such a kind that they permit intelligent life to exist? Ancient questions like these have weighed heavy on the curious minds before us, and many still to this day. With some basic concepts and an open mind, we can begin to make sense of the role that the universe itself has played in humanity’s spiritual pursuit of self-actualization. Take an afternoon journey into the cosmos with your astral guide, Minx! 

3:30-4:30pm (adjustable on time – anytime from 1:30-4:30)

   \item[Location:] Martian Playground 
    \item[Host:] Rhythm Sin Mews
    \item[Start time:] 12:00 PM
\end{description}

Greetings fellow extraterrestrials, I am Rhythm Sin, a Divine Feminine Lemurian and Arcturian from Mintakan. This round-table and meetup is being held for the purpose of establishing roots or paths, and building soul tribes in order to work towards ascending the consciousness of the entirety of humankind. Topics will be directed by those in attendance (ie, bring your knowledge and content of interest) and include astrology, soul connections, healers, oracles/psychics, sacred plant/psychedelic medicine, the 13-month calendar, the first through twelfth chakras, Starseed/planetary origins, Lemuria and Atlantis, suppressed history and Egyptian spirituality. By working within the 4th dimension together we can vibrate the frequency of pure unconditional love into ourselves and resonate among others, and therefore bring 5th dimensional energies and the New Earth into integration with our current 3rd dimensional reality, propelling us into a collective consciousness state beyond our current abilities to imagine.
