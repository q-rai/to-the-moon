\section*{Landing Site}

\gls{ttm} will be at the \href{https://www.facebook.com/CatoosaEventCenter}{Catoosa Event Center} in Jamestown, Tennessee. The site is an old golf course repurposed as an event and camping venue that has been family owned since 2014.  The wide grassy clearings and paved cart trails make for a perfect site for our art, music, and our passions.

\end{figure}

A map for planning your flight path can be found on page \pageref{image:overviewmap}.  Note the  \faWarning\xspace symbol that shows a single-lane tunnel with a 12'2", and which is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:map-choke-point}, and may be a problem for large RVs and trailers.  It's located on \href{https://goo.gl/maps/gRTxhTscssnCBaJF7}{Pilot Mountain Road just west of Rt. 27}.

% \subsubsection*{Struggle-Free Route (Green)}
% The fastest routes to Spirit Crossing are full of switchbacks to avoid various objects in orbit. If you don't mind dodging the odd satellite, you can find instructions that suit your agile rocket needs. If your spaceship is rather large or you haul a shuttle, we recommend the struggle-free route. You can find this route on the maps highlighted in green.

% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
% 	\item From Knoxville: Follow directions until \ref{us11w}.
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 	    \item After passing through Tate Springs, you will turn left onto TN-32N.
% 	\end{enumerate}
%     \item From Asheville:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Instead of turning right in Bean Station, you will follow signs for TN-32N.
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item After about 7.5 miles, turn right onto TN-131N (Mountain Valley Highway). 
%     \item About 13 miles later, turn left onto TN-31N.
%     \item Stay on TN-31N for 8.5 miles. Then, continue from step \# \ref{dir:chestnutridge} in the ``From Knoxville'' directions.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsubsection*{From Knoxville and points Southwest (Yellow)}
% You can find this route on the maps highlighted in yellow.

% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]

%     \item Continue 40 miles to merge right onto US 11W / Hwy 25 E. \label{us11w}
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item For the struggle-free route, you will turn left onto TN-32N after passing through Tate Springs (about a mile before Bean Station) and follow along from step \ref{strugglefree}.
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item After about a mile, turn left on to Main St.  You should see a red store on the left. A close-up of this area can be found on page \pageref{image:beanstation}.
%     \item In about two miles, turn left on to US 11W.
%     \item After about 2.8 miles, turn left on to TN 31.  There will be an Exxon station on the left at the intersection. \label{dir:tn31}
%     \item Drive for about 17 miles and then continue straight on to TN 66 S.
%     \item Drive 1.4 miles for slight left onto Chestnut Ridge Road.  Look for the ``To the Moon'' sign along the road; \textbf{this is a tricky intersection that's easy to miss. \label{dir:chestnutridge} You can find a picture and close-up of this area in the Sneedville area map on page \pageref{image:sneedville}}
%     \item After about \sfrac{1}{3} of a mile, turn left on to Clinch River Circle
%     \item Welcome home!  Please follow instructions in the next section, ``Landing Procedure,'' on page \pageref{sec:parking}
% \end{enumerate}

% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]

\section*{Landing Procedure}
\label{sec:parking}

% \bod[inline]{This will have to be vetted and expanded by gate and/or BoD}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item arrive at Catoosa Event Center entrance where \gls{parking} volunteers will navigate you to the COVID check station where your temperature will be checked per our COVID policy as detailed on page \pageref{covid-policy}
    \item after passing your COVID test like a rock star, check-in at \gls{gate} with tickets and ID
    \item receive wrist-band; keep this wrist-band with you at all times (please see page \pageref{sub:wristbands} for more information on wristband policy)
    \item proceed to \glspl{greeter} to be properly welcomed and oriented -- be sure to get your swag!
 	\item offload equipment at your deployment site
      \begin{itemize}
          \item If you are driving an RV or using a camper
              \begin{quote}
                  \gls{parking} will direct you to your final deployment area for RVs and campers
              \end{quote}
          \item If you are driving a regular vehicle
              \begin{itemize}
          		\item If this is a \gls{mudburn}
              		\begin{quote}
              			if the site is too muddy for vehicles, you may have to hoof in your gear; or, coordinate with the \gls{gate} on asking \gls{love} to shuttle your gear to your site
              		\end{quote}
          		\item If the grounds are driveable
              		\begin{enumerate}
                       \item Since there is limited access on-site for bringing vehicles for offloading coordinate with \gls{gate} for getting an offloading pass 
                       \item drive to site
                       \item offload gear (do NOT take the time to set up!)
                       \item drive back to \gls{gate} to return offload pass
                    \end{enumerate}
                \item If you arrive after dark (regardless of weather conditions), \gls{love} will shuttle participants' belongings from the \gls{gate} to their camps, eliminating the presence of burner blinding non-art cars freely roaming the burn field.
             \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \item return to \gls{parking} to properly land vehicle for event duration
    \item finish deploying your gear at your camping site
%      \item go to \gls{parking} to land vehicle into assigned landing pad
%     \item check-in with \gls{gate} that you have offloaded
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{General Landing Guidance}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Traffic flow is ONE WAY only!} \textbf{DO NOT TURN YOUR VEHICLE AROUND} or try to return from whence you came --- Alice only steps through the Looking Glass once!
    \item \textbf{CARPOOL!!!!} Be a good burner and pack everybody in safely. While this property has expansive fields, we still want to minimize our impact on the land and make less work for our parking pals!
    \item \textbf{Know where you are camping!!} Have a screenshot or printout of the map and a plan for where you'll be staying so there's no boondoggling at the gate!
    \item \textbf{GET TO PARKING!} DO NOT BE A SPACE CADET! You are NOT ready to burn once you unload the car! We suggest immediately taking your car to parking (following the one way flow) as soon as you've got everything out. Do not leave your car parked as you set up or afterwards. 
    \item \textbf{Don't arrive late.} Just don't. You'll feel guilty for dragging Leads out to cater to you, and we will not let you forget about it :)
\end{itemize}
