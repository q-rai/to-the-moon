Be sure to stop by Art home base at Center Camp.  Art Home Base is a large structure that includes a chill space with a craft area and craft materials, as well as a space for people who want to teach classes.  When you stop by, you can get information on our 2022 Art installations and their locations, you could sign up to take a guided art tour on our double-decker white rabbit art tour bus (times are listed under events), or you can sign up to use our shared space to teach or take a class.  Just add your class time and description to our white board.   All classes are welcome including Art, Yoga, or anything impossible that you can imagine.
