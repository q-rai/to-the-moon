\subsection*{Showers}
There are no showers \footnote{However, there may be one or two camps that provide shower facilities for everyone, but don't depend on this.}. To keep yourself clean, bring wet wipes or biodegradable soap.

\subsection*{Ice}
Ice will be sold from noon to 3 \pm every day for \$5 per bag.  Cash only! Bring small bills please. Proceeds goes to the local fire department boot drive! Check with the \gls{cockpit} for location of ice sales.


\subsection*{Lost and Found}
The Lost and Found will be at the Quartermaster area by \gls{dpw}.  However, the \gls{cockpit} will take lost items to be kept safely with the Quartermaster.

\subsection*{Port-a-Potties}
There are Port-a-Potties on-site. Please don't put anything other than one-ply toilet paper and human waste in the Port-a-Potties --- \textbf{this especially includes feminine hygiene products, which should be packed out (bring a plastic bag in with you to help with this)}. You will find Port-a-Potties in multiple locations across the site.
