# To The Moon Survival Guide
LaTeX code, Python Code, and PDF files for the To The Moon Survival Guide.

The layout was heavily inspired by the Apollo Mission flight manual, and some of the original graphics are featured in the guide.

The Survival Guide comes in several formats:
- Pre-Flight Manual: Information that attendees need prior to leaving home (general information, rules, checklist, directions to the event, etc.)
- Checklist: Stand-alone packing list.
- Pocket Guide: Smaller format version with the information needed once on site (rules, art, events, theme camps, site map, etc.)
- Greeter Guide: No-frills version of pocket guide with just the absolute essentials for quick reference.
- Flight Manual: Full document with all content in one PDF.
