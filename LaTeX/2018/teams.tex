\paragraph{Who We Are}
We are the brightly shining faces of To The Moon.  We are the ones that will help you blast off into a world of beauty youâ€™ve never know.

\paragraph{What We Do}

As Greeters, we are the first group to welcome astronauts to the Launch Pad, and we absolutely love doing it!  We, along with Gate, make the first impression on this voyage.  We help set expectations and get to communicate with the flight crew for the very first time. 

Our job is to educate ourselves deeply on the meaning of the \gls{tenprinciples} so that we can impart that knowledge onto our participants.  We're also well versed in the \gls{eleventhprinciple} and are happy to discuss!  We are here to clarify any questions you have regarding general operating procedures on the Moon. 

We are passionate about the beautiful land that is Spirit Crossing, and have educated ourselves deeply on the history of the land and special facts that are critical to understand in order to give back to nature the way she gives to us. 

Looking for some sweet \gls{swag}? Look no further than the \gls{greeter} station!  Want a good spanking?  Hey, if you say it's ok, then we're ok with it!  Have questions about where to go to sign up to volunteer? We got it!  Interested in picking up a ``No Photos'' wristband? That's covered, too!  Want to know which camps are kid-friendly?  Done and done!

Greeters are all about having FUN!  Our goal is to get you excited about coming home!  We want everyone to be safe and knowledgeable and have a hell of a time doing it!   

\paragraph{What We Need}

We are looking for outgoing, space-age, creative people to join our band of misfits.  If you are dedicated, patient, have great communication skills, and are ready to take on the truly awesome role of creating out-of-this-world merriment and moon-like magic, then volunteer with us. 

See you on the Moon!!!!

\subsection*{Perimeter}

These participants meet up before burn time and establish a burn perimeter to aid in the safety of participants during the \gls{effigy} and \gls{temple} burns.

% IMPORTANT INFO FOR ALL PERIMETER VOLUNTEERS! Please read:

% Effigy Outer Perimeter volunteers must meet at the Effigy burn field on Sat, June 16th at 4 PM for training/instructions (EFFIGY burn day). Then meet again at the specific time given at training (around dark-thirty-ish) that same day.

% Temple Outer Perimeter meet at the Effigy burn field on Sat, June 16th at 4 PM for training/instructions (same as EFFIGY perimeter training time), then meet again on SUNDAY, the next day, for Temple burn,  which will burn around 7:30 PM Sunday. So be on field by 7:30 PM.

Perimeter signup only includes \textbf{outer} perimeter shifts (no experience needed other than a mandatory training session (see times above). If you are experienced with perimeter and fire safety and want a shift doing \textbf{inner} perimeter, please email the perimeter lead directly and they will vet you for that.

\subsection*{Rangers}
% \Gls{rangers} are responsible for keeping the peace.
Rangers are the non-confrontational mediators of community and public safety and providers of information. While on shifts they will carry radios. They are super cool. They stroll the burn and are often the first point of contact should you need assistance.

\subsection*{Tbase / Sanctuary}

\Gls{tbass} provides a calm, safe space for burners who need a chance to process and integrate their experiences at and responses to the burn. We provide a supportive environment for anyone who needs reassurance, assistance, or just some peace and quiet to work through a current experience or their response to a previous experience. A burn provides a multitude of stimuli, and \gls{tbass}  offers a chance to step back, ground oneself, and experience the transformative process than being home can bring.

Volunteers should be prepared to be sober and unaltered for the duration of a 4-hour shift and able to remain calm when dealing with participants who are distressed, emotional, or experiencing an altered perception of the world around them. Anyone who has previously done Tranquility Base training for Alchemy or Euphoria, Sanctuary training for Ignite!, Transformus, or Flipside, or Zendo Project training for Burning Man can sign up for volunteer shifts now and only needs to attend a brief refresher session and an overview of To The Moon radio protocols (if you have done training for harm reduction/safe space teams at other burns, please contact Mango, the Tranquility Base Team Lead, to discuss your background). If you have not done training, please plan to attend one of the on-site training sessions on Thursday or Friday evening, and you will be able to sign up for volunteer shifts later in the burn at the end of the training or you may sign up for shifts now as long as you attend a training before your shift is scheduled.

Please plan to attend one of the on-site training sessions.

This team meets at \gls{tbass}, of course.

\subsection*{\acrlong{vc}}
% \Gls{ttm} runs on volunteers, and this stalwart crew makes sure that all the teams have the necessary folks to work effectively.
These volunteers wrangle participants of the burn into needed volunteer positions to keep things running. \glspl{vc} help people check their scheduled shifts as well as sign up for shifts. If you know how sexy volunteering is and want to meet like minded folks, this is a good team for you! We keep volunteers informed of updates during the burn and help teams fulfill unforeseen volunteer needs as they could arise during the burn.

This is also a place for people to come get information about burn happenings, times, locations, and whereabouts to things such as: workshops, theme camps, and events. Sometimes we even help people find themselves!

This team meets at the \gls{cockpit}.
