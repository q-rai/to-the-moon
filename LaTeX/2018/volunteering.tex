\chapter{Volunteering}

No burn exists without volunteers and volunteers are our heroes! We have no hired help other than security and everything we do is done on a volunteer basis.  This goes for all the things before, during, and after the burn.  All the teams that you can volunteer for are described in the ``Crew Manifest'' section starting from page \pageref{ch:teams}.

There are two ways to volunteer:

\textbf{Before the event} you can sign up from the available volunteer activities by going to:

{\indent ~~~ \url{https://www.signupgenius.com/tabs/33773df01a4c3edc42-tothemoon} }

\textbf{During the event} you can go to the \gls{vc} folks at the \gls{cockpit} to sign up for an available volunteer slot.

\section*{EARLY ENTRY FOR VOLUNTEERS}

If a participant has a volunteer shift on Wednesday, they will be granted entry at noon on Wednesday. \footnote{This is mainly \gls{gate} but a few other teams have a few volunteer shift scheduled for Wednesday for set up.}  If a participant has a volunteer shift beginning before noon on Thursday they will be granted early entry on Wednesday after 3 pm.  This list will be given to \gls{gate} from \gls{vc} before \gls{gate} opens opens on Wednesday.

All participants must be off site by noon on Monday unless they have a shift on Monday after noon. In which case they will need to have permission from \gls{vc} or one of the \gls{eventleads} to stay on site for that shift, and should stop by the \gls{vc} tent on Monday before 10 am to get their approval. All late stay volunteer must also have their camp packed before their shift on Monday and be prepared to leave immediately following that last shift.\footnote{There are other early entries granted for \glspl{themecamp}, \gls{dpw}, \glspl{teamleads}, \gls{bod}, etc,,  but those lists will be given to \gls{gate} from appropriate lead for that team. This info is just for those volunteering first shifts on teams that start when gates open or before.}

Spinners in conclave must attend one of the training events listed below.
