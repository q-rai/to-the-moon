\section*{Guidelines}
We have few rules and kindly ask you to follow them, for your safety and those around and with you.  Look at them as a compass to orient yourself by while drifting in the orbit of this event. 

\subsection*{Safety}
Safety is our number one concern, and this section covers COVID, fire, and general grounds safety.

\textbf{To the Moon encourages all participants to test before taking off for the Moon, for the safety of everyone, even if vaccinations are up-to-date.}

\subsubsection*{Fire Safety}
\label{sub:fire-safety}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red}{If you breach effigy or temple perimeter, you will be removed from the property immediately -- no questions asked!}} 
\item No open ground and / or unattended fires. They must be contained and off ground. Please bring a fire bowl for this purpose. If you see a fire that is unattended or out of control, contact a Ranger immediately.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fire Performers}
Fire performers must attend one of the fire safety meetings (listed under events) held at the Effigy and obtain a piece of conclave swag. This swag will clear you to spin fire throughout the burn at the various camps and participate in the Conclave Saturday Night.

All Conclave Participants (fire performers and fire safety volunteers, new and experienced) \textbf{must} attend the Conclave meeting (listed under events). There will be live fire extinguishes, so please wear fire safe clothing!


\subsubsection{Perimeter Safety}
\label{sub:grounds-safety}

There are several dangerous cliffs and rocky areas on the property that are fenced off for participant safety. Anyone who chooses to cross the marked boundaries will be subject to immediate removal from the property with no refund and will be liable for any damages incurred.

\subsection*{No Pets}
\label{sub:nopets}

The Catoosa Event Center has a \textbf{no pet} policy!
%
Should you need a service animal’s assistance to safely navigate our premises, please let us know at the gate.  A ``service animal'' is a dog (or other animal) individually trained to do work or perform certain tasks for a person with a disability.

Please be prepared to answer the following two questions so we may better determine at our discretion if your animal falls under the Service Animal Category, and in order for us to be in compliance with ADA regulations:
%
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Is the service animal to the direct benefit of the disability?
\item What tasks and what work is the animal trained to perform in direct relation to the disability? 
\end{itemize}
 
% If your animal falls under one of the following categories, you will not be able to bring it into the festival grounds.

% Service Animals are \textbf{not}:
% \begin{multicols}{2}
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%   \item emotional support animals
%   \item therapeutic animals
%   \item companion animals
%   \item comfort animals
%   \item service animals in training
% \end{itemize}
% \end{multicols}

% TODO Is there pet boarding in or near Jamestown?
% For your convenience, Scooby Shack Kennel is 20 minutes from Sneedville and can be reached at 423-921-0611.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding!

\subsection*{Respect the Laws of the Land}

The Catoosa Event Center and Jamestown are kind enough to be our home.  Here are some helpful tips on respect:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The property owner's house is off limits to participants.  Please be respectful of the land and grounds.
\item Although held on private property, Tennessee Nudity Laws still apply. Please plan on wearing pasties, bikinis, loincloths, etc.
\item Please respect the land and the community.  Obey the speed limits and be courteous to those around you.
\item When in doubt, practice \textbf{consent}!
\item TTM  is an all ages event.  Those who are 21 or older will have a special wrist band indicating that they are able to legally consume alcohol. Please consume in moderation.
\end{itemize}
    
% \begin{multicols}{2}

% \subsection*{Alcohol}
% \gls{ttm} is an all ages event.  Those who are 21 or older will have a special wrist band indicating that they are able to legally consume alcohol.

% \subsection*{Camping}
% You may not camp in your car. Please bring a tent or RV / trailer.
% Cars may only be brought on site with approval.
% \bod[inline]{needs vetting}

% \subsection*{Code of Conduct}
% \Gls{ttm} now has a Code of Conduct. You can find it on page~\pageref{coc}.

\subsection*{Fireworks and Effects}
Fire effects with registered Theme Camps only, please.

\subsection*{\Gls{gifting}}\label{gifting}
This is a gifting community, providing refuge from everyday societal perils.  Once you're inside, no commercial activity takes place. Which is part of the charm, and the point :) 
Sometimes, there is a bit of a misconception of "Oh, so it's a barter system?" -- Actually, it's not. It's a "Gifting" Principle.
You gift without the expectation of a gift in return. 
You gift something to someone because at that moment, you feel the other person should have the very thing you'd like to give.

% \subsection*{\Gls{graywater}}
% There are no plans to dispose of gray water on site.  Each participant is responsible for \gls{pipo}.

% \subsection*{Nudity}
% TN Nudity Laws prohibit full or partial nudity on public property, and while we are on private property, the road cutting through Spirit Crossing is public, mostly accessed by residents, so very low traffic.

% We recommend you use discretion and wear pasties, paint, bikinis, etc.

\subsection*{Minors}
Minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. If they cause problems during the event which lead to possible safety issues or are a severe nuisance to others, we may ask you to remove the offending minor, possibly your entire camp. Minors are NOT allowed to use, play with, operate nor hold fire, fire props, fire effects and pyro, including poofers.  

%\subsection*{Public Health and Safety}

\subsection*{Recharging batteries for medical equipment}
Those with CPAPs and electronic scooters will have to make their own arrangements to recharge batteries.  \gls{ttm} does not provide battery recharging stations for medical equipment.

Some theme camps have generators, and may allow use of a spare generator plug for recharging medical equipment as a way of \gls{gifting}.  Home Depot and other companies also rent generators.  Moreover, there exist solar panels for recharging CPAP machines, though those can be prohibitively expensive.

\subsection*{Photography}
Please respect the right of others who may not wish to be photographed. Ask \textbf{permission}! If you see someone with a \textcolor{blue}{blue} wristband, that is a \textbf{no photo} policy indicator. 
Do not take pictures or video of participants wearing them! 

\subsection*{Sound}
To the Moon is on new property this year.  While we all want to have a good time, it is important that we strive to be good neighbors to each other as well as the people whose homes are close to Catoosa.  We ask that anyone using any kind of amplified sound help us to minimize disturbances by respecting the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Sound camps must follow requests from the placement team on sound  placement/direction.  You can enable a hidden layer on the placement map that indicates the general desired direction for sound to face at each camp location.  We can help on-site if you need it.
    \item All camps must abide by a general limit of 90dB at every point along the perimeter of your camp.  This may be relaxed or not enforced during the day if things are going well.
    \item Sound camps must abide by all requests from rangers and the Event Leads on sound levels throughout the event, regardless of measured dB level or time of day.  There may be situations where we need to dial things back to preserve the continuity of the event itself.
    \item \textbf{Late night sound policy}, which applies to Midnight to 9AM Wednesday and Thursday nights; 4AM to 9AM Friday and Saturday nights
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During these hours, sound camps must turn your main speakers and all subwoofers off.
        \item Sound camps can continue to play music through monitor systems at a reasonable volume with the monitors pointed towards the DJ/performer.  An exception may be made in situations in which there are more than 10 people still dancing, provided the levels are still reasonable and not bothering other burn participants.
        \item All amplified sound must be turned off completely by midnight Sunday night.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repeated violations of any of these rules or repeated complaints from rangers or event leads will result in the sound system being shut down for the remainder of the event.}

\subsubsection*{A few tips for a successful sound camp}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Use an appropriate volume for the number of people dancing/listening in your camp.
    \item Keep an eye on levels as performers will try to push them too high when you're not watching the boards.
    \item Separate speaker stacks and angle them in towards a contained dancefloor.
    \item Don’t block all of your subwoofers together (run L and R subs).
    \item Use trailers, vehicles, heavy blankets, etc. to block and contain sound.
    \item Put your dancefloor under a tent.
    \item If you know how to play with surround configurations, cardoid sub configurations, horn-loaded speakers, delay etc. you can do other things to help reduce unwanted propagation.
    \item Volunteer for Rangers  No, seriously. Being on sound enforcement will give experience that can be applied to your own sound camp.
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Wristbands}
\label{sub:wristbands}
You will receive a wristband when you arrive at the \gls{gate}.  Different colored wristbands will identify you as being and adult (18+) or child.  % Wristband colors also indicate if you don't want your photo taken.  

You must keep your wristband on at all times.  See the \gls{gate} if you need to replace your wristband.

\subsection*{Vending}
No vending, selling, or promoting is allowed at the event.


\section*{Community Standards}

\subsection*{The Ten Principles}\label{tenprinciples}
Table \ref{tbl:tenprincples} on page \pageref{tbl:tenprincples} enumerates the 10 Principles of \gls{ttm}.
Funny thing about those: they are not meant to be chosen at random to suit ones need, mood or agenda, but according to our interpretation were created to work together as a whole.  
Meaning your right to radically and freely express yourself ends when your expression infringes upon another participant to do the same. 
In other words, they're not a "Getting out of jail free" card, nor a permission slip to be a dick. So don't be a dick, hiding behind one or two principles.

\subsection*{The 11th Principle -- Consent}

\gls{ttm} has adopted the 11th Principle, Consent\footnote{\url{http://www.11thprincipleconsent.org/2015/10/20/what-do-you-consent-to/}}.

% \begin{itemize}
\begin{labeling}{Photography:}
	\item[Touch:] Just because you hugged someone yesterday doesn't mean you can surprise them with a hug today. ``Surprise contact'' isn't always wanted, even if it's affectionate.
	\item[Foods:] Disclose the ingredients, one person's innocuous ingredient can be someone else's allergy.
	\item[Kink:] Consent for one thing isn't consent for another. If I said you can spank me, that doesn't give you permission to grope me.
	\item[Sex:] Consent can be revoked once it's been given.
	\item[Gifts:] Disclose what is in your gifts, even if it's just essential oils. Some people have sensitivities.
	\item[Photography:] Ask before taking pictures. Remember consent to take a picture is NOT consent to post it on your blog.
\end{labeling}
% \end{itemize}
