\subsubsection*{Struggle-Free Route (Green)}
The fastest routes to Spirit Crossing are full of switchbacks to avoid various objects in orbit. If you don't mind dodging the odd satellite, you can find instructions that suit your agile rocket needs. If your spaceship is rather large or you haul a shuttle, we recommend the struggle-free route. You can find this route on the maps highlighted in green.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item From Knoxville: Follow directions until \ref{us11w}.
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item After passing through Tate Springs, you will turn left onto TN-32N.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item From Asheville:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Instead of turning right in Bean Station, you will follow signs for TN-32N.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item After about 7.5 miles, turn right onto TN-131N (Mountain Valley Highway). 
    \item About 13 miles later, turn left onto TN-31N.
    \item Stay on TN-31N for 8.5 miles. Then, continue from step \# \ref{dir:chestnutridge} in the ``From Knoxville'' directions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{From Knoxville and points Southwest (Yellow)}
You can find this route on the maps highlighted in yellow.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Take I-40 E from downtown Knoxville.
    \item Take exit 392 for US 11W N/Rutledge Pike/Knoxville Zoo.
    \item Continue 40 miles to merge right onto US 11W / Hwy 25 E. \label{us11w}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For the struggle-free route, you will turn left onto TN-32N after passing through Tate Springs (about a mile before Bean Station) and follow along from step \ref{strugglefree}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item After about a mile, turn left on to Main St.  You should see a red store on the left. A close-up of this area can be found on page \pageref{image:beanstation}.
    \item In about two miles, turn left on to US 11W.
    \item After about 2.8 miles, turn left on to TN 31.  There will be an Exxon station on the left at the intersection. \label{dir:tn31}
    \item Drive for about 17 miles and then continue straight on to TN 66 S.
    \item Drive 1.4 miles for slight left onto Chestnut Ridge Road.  Look for the ``To the Moon'' sign along the road; \textbf{this is a tricky intersection that's easy to miss. \label{dir:chestnutridge} You can find a picture and close-up of this area in the Sneedville area map on page \pageref{image:sneedville}}
    \item After about \sfrac{1}{3} of a mile, turn left on to Clinch River Circle
    \item Welcome home!  Please follow instructions in the next section, ``Landing Procedure,'' on page \pageref{sec:parking}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{From Johnson City and points East (Dark Pink)}
You can find this route on the maps highlighted in dark pink.  Note that this routes around TN-66 near Spruce Pine Road and TN-70 near Cave Springs Rd that are closed due to mud-slides.  If relying on your own navigation system, please be aware that you cannot use these roads.  (Though, if coming from Johnson City, TN-70 should be OK for coming the final stretch as that is well above the mudslide.)

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Take I-26W
    \item Continue on US23 through Kingsport
    \item US23 turns into US23/58 in Weber City, Virginia; stay on US23/58.

\section*{Landing Procedure}
\label{sec:parking}

% \bod[inline]{This will have to be vetted and expanded by gate and/or BoD}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item arrive at Spirit Crossing entrance where \gls{parking} volunteers will navigate you to a staging area for check-in
    \item check-in at \gls{gate} with tickets and ID
    \item receive wrist-band; keep this wrist-band with you at all times (please see page \pageref{sub:wristbands} for more information on wristband policy)
    \item proceed to \glspl{greeter} to be properly welcomed and oriented -- be sure to get your swag!
 	\item offload equipment at your deployment site
      \begin{itemize}
          \item If you are driving an RV or using a camper
              \begin{quote}
                  \gls{parking} will direct you to your final deployment area for RVs and campers
              \end{quote}
          \item If you are driving a regular vehicle
              \begin{itemize}
          		\item If this is a \gls{mudburn}
              		\begin{quote}
              			if the site is too muddy for vehicles, you may have to hoof in your gear; or, coordinate with the \gls{gate} on asking \gls{love} to shuttle your gear to your site
              		\end{quote}
          		\item If the grounds are driveable
              		\begin{enumerate}
                       \item Since there is limited access on-site for bringing vehicles for offloading coordinate with \gls{gate} for getting an offloading pass 
                       \item drive to site
                       \item offload gear (do NOT take the time to set up!)
                       \item drive back to \gls{gate} to return offload pass

                \item If you arrive after dark (regardless of weather conditions), \gls{love} will shuttle participants' belongings from the \gls{gate} to their camps, eliminating the presence of burner blinding non-art cars freely roaming the burn field.
             \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \item return to \gls{parking} to properly land vehicle for event duration
    \item finish deploying your gear at your camping site
%      \item go to \gls{parking} to land vehicle into assigned landing pad
%     \item check-in with \gls{gate} that you have offloaded

\section*{Crew Equipment}
% Things to do / pack before leaving
\gls{ttm} is an exercise in radical self-reliance.  This means bringing everything you are going to need, which includes food, water, shelter, any medications, and hygiene products.  You must take responsibility for your own well-being and survival.  Do not expect the community to take care of you.  Though there are EMTs on site, they are only an emergency resource, so do not rely on them for basic over-the-counter medications.

\subsection*{Crew Inventory Checklist}
Below is a list of items we suggest you bring with you.  A burn requires a certain amount of preparation to be able to sustain you for 4--5 days of camping with minimal amenities. Please come prepared.  While this isn't the Playa, the nearest store is a bit removed so pack what you need and extra.  

% The following are checklists for items that are recommended to bring to ensure maximum likelihood of survival and an otherwise hoopilicious time.  The first checklist is for items that crew should bring; the second are for nice to have items.

\subsubsection*{Must Haves}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{checklist}
	\item \textbf{A valid, state-issued} photo ID
